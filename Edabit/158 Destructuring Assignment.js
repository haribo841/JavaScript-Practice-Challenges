/*You can assign variables from arrays like this:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
first = arr[0]
second = arr[1]
third = arr[2]
other = arr.slice(3)

console.log(first) ➞ outputs 1
console.log(second) ➞ outputs 2
console.log(third) ➞ outputs 3
console.log(other) ➞ outputs [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
However, this is long and tedious.
Instead, we can use Object Destructuring to create all those variables in one line.
Your task: Create variables first, second, third and other from the given array using Destructuring Assignment
Your task is to unpack the arr writeyourcodehere into four variables, first, second, third, and other.*/
writeyourcodehere = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
const [first, second, third, ...other] = writeyourcodehere;
import { assertEquals } from '../testHelper.js';
assertEquals(first, 1)
assertEquals(second, 2)
assertEquals(third, 3)
assertEquals(other, [4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
